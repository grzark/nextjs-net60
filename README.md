# nextjs-net60

Hi techies, this time I was working on a Next.js app using SpaServices from .NET 6.0 and got into trouble making it work so let's see how to do it properly.

## TLDR;
You can check the repository that includes the .NET project hosting Next.js application ( jesulink2514/nextjs-net60 (github.com) ), look at nextjs-net60 project and review the following files for configuration changes:

`nextjs-net60.csproj`
`Program.cs`
`ClientApp/next.config.js`
`CientApp/package.json`

## Detailed Explanation and Instructions
I published a blog post about this sample where there is a detailed explanation of the config so check it out in you are interested on it.
